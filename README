Embedded Ruby Console that is aware of Spring lifecycle capabilities. It'll dump all your declared Spring stuff into the Ruby container for easy access at modifying/using your singletons. This console is very good for modifying behavior at runtime, or simply getting easy access to the underlying guts to create adhoc scripts. Primarily used as a console used by applications deployed to an OSGi container (Servicemix). In fact, design is heavily borrowed from the Karaf SSH console. Code that was modified from Apache Karaf retains original Apache License comments and authorship notice where applicable.
